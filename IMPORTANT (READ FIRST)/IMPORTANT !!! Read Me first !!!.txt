IMPORTANT!!!
**Read and follow the instructions below before start running our website. (Hope Plate)

This folder has PHP files, CSS files, and Configuration Settings files.

There are two Configuration Settings files: php and sendmail.

The following steps are important to make our additional feature, sending emails work:
1. Copy the sendmail file in this folder.
2. Go to XAMPP, and select the sendmail folder.
3. Paste the Configuration file (sendmail) inside the folder to replace the default file.
4. Copy the php file in this folder.
5. Go to XAMPP, and select the php folder.
6. Paste the Configuration file (php) inside the folder to replace the default file.

**IMPORTANT: YOU ARE ADVISED TO MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF BOTH FILES BEFORE EXECUTING THE STEPS ABOVE... 
 

Feel free to remove both files and use back the default one after you do not want to visit our website anymore... (or after finished marking)


Thank you for visiting our website!
